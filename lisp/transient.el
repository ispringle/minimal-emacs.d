;;; transient.el --- Load transient -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; It's sort of overkill to load transient by itself, but it's needed by lots of
;; stuff, just felt right to do this... We load it this way to use the latest,
;; not built-in

;;; Code:

(use-package transient
  :ensure t)

;;; transient.el ends here
