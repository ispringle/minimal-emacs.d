;;; envvar.el --- Loads envvars into Emacs -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;; Commentary:
;; This is to get the proper envvars loaded into Emacs, for some reason on MacOS it doesn't always load the right vars.

;;; Code:

(defun load-env-file (file)
  "Read and set envvars from FILE."
  (if (null (file-exists-p file))
      (signal 'file-error
              (list "No envvar file exists." file
                    "Run `emacs --script ~/.config/emacs/scripts/gen-env-file.el`."))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert-file-contents file)
      (when-let (env (read (current-buffer)))
        (let ((tz (getenv-internal "TZ")))
          (setq-default
           process-environment
           (append env (default-value 'process-environment))
           exec-path
           (append (split-string (getenv "PATH") path-separator t)
                   (list exec-directory))
           shell-file-name
           (or (getenv "SHELL")
               (default-value 'shell-file-name)))
          (when-let (newtz (getenv-internal "TZ"))
            (unless (equal tz newtz)
              (set-time-zone-rule newtz))))
        env))))

(load-env-file "~/.config/minimal-emacs.d/local/env.el")
