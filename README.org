*  minimal-emacs.d
My emacs config based on [[https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d][minimal-emacs.d]]

** Setup
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd ~/.config
  git clone git@github.com:ispringle/minimal-emacs.d
  cd ./minimal-emacs.d
  sh setup.sh
#+END_SRC

The above should be all it takes to get stuff started. It will clone this repo,
than run the setup script which in turn clones the minimal-emacs.d repo to
~$HOME/.emacs.d/~ directory, and then will softlink the ~pre-early-init.el~ file
from /this/ repo into the ~emacs.d~ directory. From there, just start emacs and let
the packages install.

At least on MacOS, you will probably also need to run the ~gen-env-file.el~ script
located in the ~scripts~ directory, this will ensure that you env vars and in
particular your ~PATH~ is properly loaded into emacs.
